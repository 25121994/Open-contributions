<h2>Supervised Machine Learning</h2>
<p>supervised machine learning, is a subcategory of machine learning and artificial intelligence. It is defined by its use of labeled datasets to train algorithms that to classify data or predict outcomes accurately.</p>

  <h2>Unsupervised Machine Learning</h2>
<p>Unsupervised learning is a type of algorithm that learns patterns from untagged data. The hope is that through mimicry, the machine is forced to build a compact internal representation of its world and then generate imaginative content</p>
  <h2>Reinforcement Learning</h2>
<p>Reinforcement learning is an area of machine learning concerned with how intelligent agents ought to take actions in an environment in order to maximize the notion of cumulative reward. Reinforcement learning is one of three basic machine learning paradigms, alongside supervised learning and unsupervised learning.</p>

  <h2>Neural Networks</h2>
<p>Artificial neural networks, usually simply called neural networks, are computing systems vaguely inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains. An ANN is based on a collection of connected units or nodes called artificial neurons, which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain</p>

  <h2>OpenCV</h2>
<p>OpenCV is a library of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time computer vision</p>
  <h2>Regression</h2>
<p>Regression is a statistical method used in finance, investing, and other disciplines that attempts to determine the strength and character of the relationship between one dependent variable (usually denoted by Y) and a series of other variables (known as independent variables).</p>
  <h2>Classification</h2>
<p>Classification is a process of categorizing a given set of data into classes, It can be performed on both structured or unstructured data. The process starts with predicting the class of given data points. The classes are often referred to as target, label or categories</p>

 <h2>Data Preprocessing</h2>
<p>Data preprocessing is a data mining technique that involves transforming raw data into an understandable format. Real-world data is often incomplete, inconsistent, and/or lacking in certain behaviors or trends, and is likely to contain many errors. Data preprocessing is a proven method of resolving such issues.</p>

<h2>Exploratory Data Analysis</h2>
<p>In statistics, exploratory data analysis is an approach of analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics, often using statistical graphics and other data visualization methods</p>
