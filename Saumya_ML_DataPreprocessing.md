# Data Preprocessing in Machine Learning

## What is Data Preprocessing?

 Data Preprocessing is a technique that is used to convert the raw data into a clean data set. It is the most important step to oraganize the data into meaningful manner. Its main aim is to produce clean and efficient code so that it can be easily be understood by machine.
 It also helps to reduce the time while analyzing the data and also improves to understand the code and increase readability.

## Why Data Preprocessing?

 Since now-a-days thw world highly depends upon data and the data needs to be organised in appropriate manner.Data preprocessing helps in the real-world data to store efficiently and thereby making it ready-to-go for Machine Learning Models.
 It also helps to select the most efficient model in Machine Learning.

# Various Steps in Data Preprocessing in Machine Learning.

## 1. Importing the libraries.

  #### The predefined Python libraries can perform specific data preprocessing jobs.
  #### The three core Python libraries used for this data preprocessing in Machine Learning are:

## a. Numpy
   
    import numpy as np
   
    It is the fundamental library which is used for the scientific calculations and is widely used. 
    It is mainly used to deal with large multidimensional arrays and matrices in the code.
   
## b. Matplotlib
   
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    
    It is a library which is used to plot any type of charts and graphs across any platform like: 
    Jupyter Notebook or Web Application Servers.
    It helps to easily visualize the data.
    
## c. Pandas
    
    import pandas as pd
     
    Pandas is an excellent open-source Python library for data manipulation and analysis. 
    It is extensively used for importing the Dataset and also create matrix of features and dependent variables.
