# Bias-Variance Tradeoff
## What is Bias & Variance :
### Variance : 
<br>It is the tendency of algorithm to fluctuate very sensitively to fit highly flexible models and learning random things. High variance would cause an algorithm to model the noise in the training set. High variance is as **overfitting**. </br>
**Overfitting** is a modeling error that occurs when a function is too closely fit to a limited set of data points. Overfitting happens when a model learns the detail and noise in the training data to the extent that it negatively impacts the performance of the model on new data. This means that the noise or random fluctuations in the training data is picked up and learned as concepts by the model. The problem is that these concepts do not apply to new data and negatively impact the models ability to generalize.
