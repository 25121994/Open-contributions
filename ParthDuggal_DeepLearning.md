#  Deep Learning Topics

## Artificial Neural Networks
* Basic theory on how neural networks work.
* Backprop and gradient descent
* Vectorisaztion in order to speed up neural networks.
* Knowledge about maths behind neural networks.
* Implementing using keras and tensorflow.
* Normalization techniques.
* Gradient Checking
* Theory behind Stochastic Gradient Descent, Batch Gradient Descent and mini batch
* Regualrization uses and techniques like L2 and L1, dropout and Data Augmentation.
* Adam and Rmsprop
* Softmax,relu,tanh and sigmoid
* Bias and Variance problems.
* Hyperparameter tuning. 

## Convolutional Neural Network
* Basics of CNNs.
* CNN operation, max pooling, global average pooling, flattening ,etc.
* Knowledge of Resnets,Alexnet, VGG,Densenet, Squeezenet,Mobilenet,Inception Network and other state of the art techniques.
* YOLO
* Siamese networks, face verification techniques and neural style transfer techniqes(little bit)
* Implementing using tensorflow and Keras

## Recurrent Neural Networks
* Rnns, language models, LSTMs, GRUs
* Word Embeddings
* Bleu Score,Attention Model and Beam Search (Not so strong in this)
