### I have a intermediate knowledge in ***Python*** and ***ML***  :)

---
***Python***
- Python is a general-purpose interpreted, interactive, object-oriented, and high-level programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum during 1985- 1990. 

- Following are important characteristics of Python Programming âˆ’
   1. It supports functional and structured programming methods as well as OOP.

    2. It can be used as a scripting language or can be compiled to byte-code for building large applications.

    3. It provides very high-level dynamic data types and supports dynamic type checking.

    4. It supports automatic garbage collection.

    5. It can be easily integrated with C, C++, COM, ActiveX, CORBA, and Java.




>TOPICS I KNOW IN PYTHON ARE :
 - Python - Basic Syntax

 ***Machine Learnng***
  - Machine learning is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience. It is seen as a subset of artificial intelligence. 

>TOPICS I KNOW IN ML ARE:
   - Difference between Supervised learning and Unsupervised learning 
   - Supervised learning
        1. Linear Regression 
        2. Logistic Regression 

***OpenCV***

- OpenCV is a library of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time computer vision. Originally developed by Intel, it was later supported by Willow Garage     then Itseez. The library is cross-platform and free.
- Applications:
   1. Facial recognition system
   2. Motion tracking
   3. Object identification
   4. Gesture recognition
     and many more...
     
 >  I am not well proficient with OpenCV. But I am  really interested  and determined to learn and understand.

> I look forward to learn and understand it , I am confident that I can complete the work along with mentorship.
