## SETS
 - In Python, Set is an unordered collection of data type that is iterable, mutable and has no duplicate elements.  
 - The order of elements in a set is undefined though it may consist of various elements
##### Example :
    thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
    print(thisset)

    # Note: the set list is unordered, meaning: the items will appear in a random order.
    # Note: Sets are unordered, so you cannot be sure in which order the items will appear.
