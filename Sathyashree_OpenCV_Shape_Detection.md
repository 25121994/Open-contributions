### Shape Detection

Basically ***Shape Detection*** is nothing but **finding** different shapes in an image and **identifying** them. This process involves multi-steps.
- *Installing* **pip** and **imutils**.
- *Importing* the necessary **libraries**.
- *Creating* the ***ShapeDetector*** **class**.
- *Loading* and *processing* the image and *finding* the contours.
- *Finding the **center of each contour** and detecting the shape.
- *Displaying* the **output image**.
