## PYTHON CLASSES AND OBJECTS
 - Python is an object oriented programming language.
 - A class is a user-defined prototype from which objects are created. 
 - Classes provide a means of  functionality together.
 - Creating a new class creates a new type of object, allowing new instances of that type to be made.
 - Each class instance can have  its own attributes.
 - Class instances can also have methods (defined by its class) for modifying its state.
### POINTS TO REMEMBER ON PYTHON CLASS:
 - Classes are created by keyword class.
 - Attributes are the variables that belong to class.
 - Attributes are always public and can be accessed using dot (.) operator. 
#### Class

###### Create a Class
    To create a class, use the keyword class:
       
     class car:
      x = 5
     print(car)
 
 ###### output:
    <class '__main__.car'>
    
#### Class Objects
 - An Object is an instance of a Class. A class is like a blueprint while an instance is a copy of the class with actual values.
 - An object consists of :
      1.State : It is represented by attributes of an object. It also reflects the properties of an object.
      2.Behavior : It is represented by methods of an object. It also reflects the response of an object with other objects.
      3.Identity : It gives a unique name to an object and enables one object to interact with other objects
###### Create Object
      Now we can use the class named car to create objects:
