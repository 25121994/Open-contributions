## PYTHON CLASSES AND OBJECTS
 - Python is an object oriented programming language.
 - A class is a user-defined prototype from which objects are created. 
 - Classes provide a means of  functionality together.
 - Creating a new class creates a new type of object, allowing new instances of that type to be made.
 - Each class instance can have  its own attributes.
 - Class instances can also have methods (defined by its class) for modifying its state.
### POINTS TO REMEMBER ON PYTHON CLASS:
 - Classes are created by keyword class.
 - Attributes are the variables that belong to class.
 - Attributes are always public and can be accessed using dot (.) operator. 


###### Create a **Class**
    To create a class, use the keyword class:
       
     class car:
      x = 5
     print(car)
 
 ###### output:
    <class '__main__.car'>
    
#### Class Objects
 - An Object is an instance of a Class. A class is like a blueprint while an instance is a copy of the class with actual values.
 * An object consists of :
 
         1. State : It is represented by attributes of an object. It also reflects the properties of an object.
         2. Behavior : It is represented by methods of an object. It also reflects the response of an object with other objects.
         3. Identity : It gives a unique name to an object and enables one object to interact with other objects
         
###### Create Object ( Example 1 )
      Now we can use the class named car to create objects:
   
      class car:
          x = 5

     p1 = car()
     print(p1.x)
###### output:
     5
     Maruti

     
###### Example 2     
    class Jeep:  
      
               # A simple class 
               # attribute 
          company = "Maruti"
          location = "India"
  
              # A sample method   
          def test(self):  
               print("I'm from", self.company) 
               print("I'm made in ", self.location) 
  

    # Object instantiation 
    jimny = Jeep() 
  
    # Accessing class attributes 
    # and method through objects 
    print(jimny.company) 
    jimny.test() 

###### output:
    Maruti
    I'm from Maruti
    I'm made in  India
    
In the above example, an object is created which is basically a ***Jeep*** named ***jimny***. This class only has two class attributes that tell us that ***jimny*** is from ***Maruti*** and made from ***India***.<br>
**NOTE**: The  ***self***  parameter is a reference to the current instance of the class, and is used to access variables that belong to the class.

***The self***
 - Class methods must have an extra first parameter in method definition. We do not give a value for this parameter when we call the method, Python provides it.
 - If we have a method which takes no arguments, then we still have to have one argument.
 - This is similar to this pointer in C++ and this reference in Java.
 
 **The __init__() Function**
  - The __init__ method is similar to constructors in C++ and Java.
  - Constructors are used to initialize the objectâ€™s state. Like methods, a constructor also contains a collection of statements(i.e. instructions) that are executed at the time of Object creation. 
  - It is run as soon as an object of a class is instantiated. The method is useful to do any initialization you want to do with your object.
  - All classes have a function called __init__(), which is always executed when the class is being initiated.
  - Use the __init__() function to assign values to object properties, or other operations that are necessary to do when the object is being created:
