## Contours

Basically, **Contour** can be defined as an *outline* or a *border* of any object. *Contours* in Python is a ***list*** of contours of an object, which can be an image, a frame from a video and so on. Each *Contour* in the list *Contours* is a point represented as (x , y) which represent the position of the point with respect to the two axes. The contoural points usually have the same intensity.

Contours are mainly **used** in ***Object Detection***. Working with contours is very handy and have application in determining the size and shape of an object. Briefly stating, Contour finds its applications in anything that involves shape analysis, object detection and recognition.
