### Data Science

**Data Science is the field that uses scientific methods, processes and algorithms to extract meaning insights from structured or unstructured data**

***Here are the steps of the Data Science methodology***

1. Business Understanding - Here we decide what's our actual goal is according to the business requirements.

2. Analytical Understanding - Based on the above business understanding one should decide analytical approach to follow.

3. Data Requirements - What type of data we are going to have to solve the specific peoblem ?

4. Data Collection - Data collected can be obtained in any random format. So, according to the approach chosen and the output to be obtained, 
                     the data collected should be validated. Thus, if required one can gather more data or discard the irrelevant data.
                     
5. Data Preparation - Making the collected data more insightful by removing the unnecessary details.

6. Modelling - Modelling decides whether the data prepared for processing is appropriate or requires more finishing.
               This phase focusses on the building of predictive/descriptive models.
               
7. Evaluation - After preparing the model, evaluation will be done on it whehther it is able to handle the business requirements or not. If not go back to step 5 and 6.

8. Deployment - As the model is effectively evaluated it is made ready for deployment in the business market. 
                Deployment phase checks how much the model can withstand in the external environment and perform superiorly as compared to others.
            
9. Feedback - Feedback is the necessary purpose which helps in refining the model and accessing its performance and impact. 
              We can make changes to our model according to the feedback.
