# Python OOPs Concepts

learning OOPs is Smart ~~difficult~~

Like the other general programming languages,Python is also an ***Object-Oriented Programming*** language.
It allows us to develop applictions using an object oriented approach.In Python,we can easily create and use classes and objects

**Major Topics in OOPS are:**

- Class
- Objects
- Methods
- Inheritance
- Encapsulation
- Polymorphism
- Data Abstraction

> This main objective of this documentation is to make understand these concepts in a "Simple way".

**<ins>Class:</ins>**

 It's the blueprint of any object where we intiliaze the necessary parameters to construct our object
 
+ Functions inside class is called as ***Methods***
+ Class name should start with an upper case alphabet and followed by some methods

**Syntax**
```
class Classname:
   methods():
      <statements>
```

**<ins>Objects:</ins>**


The object is an entity that has state and behaviour.Simply, It's the output from our class.
Everything in python is an object and almost everything has attributes and methods.All functions have a built-in attribute **doc**,which returns the doc string defined in the function source code 

we create object by specifying a variable to the class

**Syntax**
```
class Classname:
  methods():
    <statements>
   
c1 = Classname()
```
**<ins>Methods:</ins>**


The method is a function that is associated with an object. In python, a method is not a unique to class instances. Any object type can have methods

**<ins>Inheritance:</ins>**
