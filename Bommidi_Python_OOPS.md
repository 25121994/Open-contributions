# Python OOPs Concepts

Like the other general programming languages,Python is also an ***Object-Oriented Programming*** language.
It allows us to develop applictions using an object oriented approach.In Python,we can easily create and use classes and objects

**Major Topics in OOPS are:**

- Class
- Objects
- Inheritance
- Encapsulation
- Polymorphism
- Data Abstraction

> This main objective of this documentation is to make understand these concepts in a "Simple way".

**<ins>Class:</ins>**

 It's the blueprint of any object where we intiliaze the necessary parameters to construct our object
 
+ we intiliaze our needs in functions called ***Methods***
+ 



**<ins>Objects:</ins>**

The output for our blueprint is called as objects. 

we create object by specifying a variable to the class
